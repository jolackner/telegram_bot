# A Minimalist Telegram Bot for Document Queries

A simple Telegram Bot that answers questions on this document by the Geneva Hospice General: 
https://www.hospicegeneral.ch/sites/default/files/Directives_version_validee_DSE.pdf  
It tries to answer any question on this specific topic in Ukrainian.   
But the code could be easily adapted to answer questions in natural language on any kind of document. In order to do that, you would need to first convert your document to a searchable vectorbase. This [LangChain tutorial](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/vectorstores/examples/chroma.html) shows how.

NOTE/DISCLAIMER: this is NOT an official bot by the Hospice General. Any info you take from this bot should be confirmed directly by getting in contact with the Hospice General. 

In order to host this or a similar bot, you need:
- an OpenAI account and token
- a Telegram account and token
- (optionally) a Google Translate account and credentials
- a hosting platform that can serve the bot, for example [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/). 

This bot makes use of the wonderful LangChain framework: https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html   
It takes advantage of the python telegram-bot wrapper: https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot   
The code has been adapted from this template: https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/blob/master/examples/echobot.py
