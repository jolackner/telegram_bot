# A Minimalist Telegram Bot for Document Queries

A simple Telegram Bot that answers questions on  a pdf document - in this example, [guidelines](https://www.hospicegeneral.ch/sites/default/files/Directives_version_validee_DSE.pdf) of the "Geneva Hospice General". It tries to answer any question on this topic in Ukrainian, as Ukrainians newly arriving to Geneva might find info on social services etc useful. The underlying document is written in dense French legalese. The answers try to be a bit more intellegible :)     

The code could be easily adapted to answer questions to any other document. In order to do this, you would need to convert your document or documents to a searchable vector database. This [LangChain tutorial](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/vectorstores/examples/chroma.html) shows how. 

DISCLAIMER: this is NOT an official bot by the Hospice General. Any info you take from this bot should be confirmed by getting in contact with the Hospice General. 

In order to make this or a similar bot, you need:
- an OpenAI account and token
- a Telegram account and token
- (optionally) a Google Translate account and credentials
- a hosting platform that can serve the bot, for example on [Pythonanywhere](https:www.pythonanywhere.com).

This bot makes use of the wonderful  [LangChain framework](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html)   
It takes advantage of the [python telegram-bot wrapper](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot)   
The code has been adapted from [this](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/blob/master/examples/echobot.py) template.
